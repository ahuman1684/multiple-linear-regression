# Multiple Linear Regression

This repository contains datasets and a Python notebook demonstrating the implementation of multiple linear regression models. The focus is on understanding the relationship between independent variables (e.g., R&D spending, administration, marketing expenses) and a dependent variable (e.g., profit).

## Repository Contents

### 1. Files

- **50_Startups.csv**: Dataset for multiple linear regression, detailing information on startups' R&D spending, administration costs, marketing spending, and profit.
- **Copy_of_multiple_linear_regression.ipynb**: Python notebook demonstrating the implementation of multiple linear regression using the `50_Startups.csv` dataset.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/multiple-linear-regression.git
   ```

2. **Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
   - `pandas`
   - `numpy`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `scikit-learn`

   Install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open the Jupyter notebook to explore multiple linear regression implementations:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
