# Simple and Multiple Linear Regression

This repository contains datasets and Python notebooks demonstrating the implementation of simple and multiple linear regression models. The focus is on understanding the relationship between independent variables (e.g., years of experience, R&D spending, administration, etc.) and dependent variables (e.g., salary, profit).

## Repository Contents

### 1. Files

- **Salary_Data.csv**: Dataset for simple linear regression, showing the relationship between years of experience and salary.
- **Extended_Salary_Data.csv**: Extended version of the Salary_Data dataset with 100,000 entries for analysis and modeling.
- **50_Startups.csv**: Dataset for multiple linear regression, detailing information on startups' R&D spending, administration costs, marketing spending, and profit.
- **Copy_of_multiple_linear_regression.ipynb**: Python notebook demonstrating the implementation of multiple linear regression using the `50_Startups.csv` dataset.

### 2. Highlights

- **Simple Linear Regression**:
  - Dataset: `Salary_Data.csv` (and its extended version).
  - Goal: Predict salary based on years of experience.
  - Tools: Python's `scikit-learn` library for model building and prediction.

- **Multiple Linear Regression**:
  - Dataset: `50_Startups.csv`.
  - Goal: Predict profit based on R&D spending, administration costs, and marketing expenditure.
  - Tools: Python's `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scikit-learn` for data analysis and regression modeling.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/linear-regression.git
   ```

2. **Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
   - `pandas`
   - `numpy`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `scikit-learn`

   Install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Run the Notebooks**:
   Open the Jupyter notebooks to explore simple and multiple linear regression implementations:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Key Features

- Preprocessed datasets for straightforward regression analysis.
